#### Depths
This was a 2D platforming game that I created with my Senior Design team at UCF. We developed this game in Unity and used tools such as Aesprite to create custom art for the game. I developed the platforming segments and worked as the project manager, artist and animator. This game is hosted on Itch.io and can be found by clicking [here.](https://potatoslayer1738.itch.io/depths)
