### Other Projects 
I have worked on some projects that did not make it onto a GitHub repository. They can be found below.

#### Depths
This was a 2D platforming game that I created with my Senior Design team at UCF. We developed this game in Unity and used tools such as Aesprite to create custom art for the game. I developed the platforming segments and worked as the project manager, artist and animator. This game is hosted on Itch.io and can be found by clicking [here.](https://potatoslayer1738.itch.io/depths)

#### Hackathon Highlights
I try to participate in Hackathons when I can. They are great opprotunities to try new things, meet new people and build technical and soft skills. I have been blessed to complete several hackthon projects and I wanted to highlight a few of them here:
